# EHL
MATLAB solver for Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) problems. The solver is based on an Finite Volume (FV) discretization of the Reynolds equation incorporating mass-conserving cavitation through the cavity fraction and elastic deformation through the application of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to an elastic half-space. Shear thinning, Roelands and Dowson-Higginson relations are also embedded in the code. Furthermore, the load-balance equation is considered.

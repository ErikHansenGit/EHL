# EHL-FBNS Solver
MATLAB solver for unsteady Elasto-Hydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) problems, based on the EHL-FBNS algorithm. The solver uses the Finite Volume (FV) discretization of the Reynolds equation incorporating mass-conserving cavitation through the cavity fraction and elastic deformation through the application of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to an elastic half-space. Shear thinning, Roelands and Dowson-Higginson relations are also embedded in the code. Furthermore, the load-balance equation is considered.


The code consists out of three main scripts which must be executed consecutively and two optional scripts:  
Optional: the scripts denoted with EHL_00_run will set up and run severeal EHL solver simulations within one study.  
The scripts denoted with EHL_01_setup will set up the input information for the EHL solver.  
The script denoted with EHL_02_mainprocess incorporates the actual EHL solver and computes the solution of the EHL problem.  
The scripts denoted with EHL_03_visualization displays plots of the results obtained by the solver.  
Optional: the script denoted with EHL_04_animation creates videos of unsteady simulations.


Furthermore, there are four simulation studies:  
The codes denoted with Study_A replicate the unsteady setup of:

The codes denoted with Study_B replicate the steady setup of:

The codes denoted with Study_C4 replicate the steady setup of:
Woloszynski, T.; Podsiadlo, P. & Stachowiak, G. W. Efficient Solution to the Cavitation Problem in Hydrodynamic Lubrication Tribology Letters, 2015, 58.
The codes denoted with Study_E4 replicate a steady setup for comparison to the analytical solution of:
